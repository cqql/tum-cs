  We describe the need for flux and slope limiting in higher-order methods for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations.
  First, we explore the phenomena of oscillations and smearing that can develop at discontinuities and points of steep gradients.
  Then we introduce flux and slope limiters that are commonly used to mitigate these problems.
  In particular we look at the minmod-limiter\cite{VanLeer1979} and the moment limiter\cite{Krivodonova}.
