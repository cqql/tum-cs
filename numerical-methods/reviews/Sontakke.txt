# Summary

Discontinuous Galerkin methods are a class of numerical schemes for solving
equations arising from conservation laws that draw on the finite volume as well
as the finite element schemes. The solution is approximated by a piecewise
continuous polynomial on a discretized mesh that represents the local solutions
either in modal or in nodal form.

The approximation satisfies the equation insofar that the inner product its
residual and a selection of test functions is 0. This postulation in turn yields
the strong as well as the weak form of the problem. The weak form leads to the
semi-discrete weak form which can be reformulated to the DG-FEM method.

At this point the paper examines the numerical flux that is included in the
DG-FEM method and needs to be reconciled from the potentially conflicting fluxes
that were computed on neighboring cells. Therefore it first establishes
conditions that guarantee the stability of the scheme that in turn impose a
condition on the flux term.

Finally, a last section sketches the generalization of this approach to
non-linear conservation laws.

# Review

## Categories

### Abstract (Points: 5)

The first sentence tells the reader what this paper is about, followed by a very
brief description and an enumeration of the main points of this paper. Notably
everything is in active voice.

### Formal Aspects (Points: 4)

The formal parts where overall fine and I found no downright errors though I had
a few confusions listed below.

- First, why is the suffix for approximations _h? Does that have a special
  meaning or is it just mark the approximations? And why is it an h?
- The equation N = N_p - 1 should state the meaning of N_p explicitly say that
  it is just an abbreviation for N + 1. At the moment N_p looks meaningful
  though it is never explained. Is it the order of accuracy?
- If the polynomial basis and the basis of test functions differ in general,
  they should be denoted by different symbols. In the later sections with the
  Galerkin approach it is of course fine to plug the polynomial basis for these
  new symbols.
- "As we will see in the further sections, there are methods where the two
  functions differ." This should say "bases" instead of "functions".
- The space of test functions V_h cannot be the space of piecewise smooth
  functions because that is of infinite dimension which is in particular
  greater than N_p.
- Equation (8) is missing a d/dt and the +- should be a -
- Equation (10) should integrate over Omega instead of D^k

### Structure (Points: 3)

The paper has a section called introduction, a few main sections that describe
different aspects of the DG methods and a conclusion. However, the first section
reads rather like first part of the main portion. I think that it should be
preceded by a section that tells the reader what DG is, why it is necessary and
briefly compares it to the related methods FVM and FEM.

### Content, Level of Detail and Completeness (Points: 5)

Because discontinuous Galerkin methods are a large topic, there has to be a
trade-off between level of detail and completeness here and I mostly agree with
the author's choice. However, I would have preferred to trade in the section on
the extension to non-linear equations for a deeper explanation of the
foundations. In particular I would have liked a more elaborate description of
the weak and strong forms and how/when which is used. The same is true for test
functions. The paper just defines and uses them without justifying why they are
necessary and how the orthogonality of residual and test functions makes the
residual vanish.

Lastly, I have to following minor points to mention. I think the author could
have named the Legendre basis instead of/in addition to the monomial basis as an
example because to my knowledge it is more relevant in practice and also has a
positive effect on the shape of the mass matrix. A few sentences later the
author mentions the property of the Lagrange polynomials that l_i^k(x_j^k) =
\delta_ij which is never used, so it could be omitted. The paragraph that
highlights the problem of multiple values on the interfaces should only
reference figure 3 instead of both 2 and 3.

When equation (8) is compacted into the matrix equation, I would have liked a
hint regarding what happens to the integral because it took me a while to figure
out that it is absorbed in the inner products. (Actually until this fact is
explicitly written down on page 4).

Finally I would have preferred to put the explanation of the upwind flux before
its analysis instead of the other way around.

### Written Style and Readability (Points: 5)

The paper was pleasant to read and had no spelling mistakes. Besides that I just
noticed a missing word and one grammatical oversight listed below.

- "we use _a_ local polynomial basis ..." Put in the "a" and erase the comma
- "... we must decide in which sense does the approximate solution ... satisfies
  our PDE." Write "does satisfy" or "satisfies".

### References (Points: 2)

The author gives a few references, though only in the very last sentence of this
paper as recommendations for further reading. So there are no explicit sources
given for the theory presented. In my opinion the author should have at least
written something along the lines of "We will follow (closely) the introduction
in [1, chapter 3]" or "we will draw on the presentation in [1, chapter 3]" in
the introduction.

### Conclusion (Points: 5)

The conclusion has everything I am looking for. It starts with a recapitulation
of the covered theory. This follows an enumeration of open ends where method can
or has to be further developed before it can be implemented. Finally the author
refers the reader to further literature.

### Overall Evaluation (Points: 4.5)

Overall I enjoyed this paper and found just a handful of shortcomings. Though in
comparison to the content and readability these carry little weight for me.

## Best and Worst Aspect of the Paper

### What is best in the paper?

I liked it in general though just to pinpoint something, I will point out the
illustration for the average flux and flux difference.

### What is worst in the paper?

That is has no introduction.
