Title of the reviewed paper: Limiters for Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes
Name of the author of the reviewed paper: Marten Lienen

2 Summary
=========
At the heart of the paper are so called limiters for discontinuous Galerkin
schemes.  Galerkin schemes are used to solve differential equations. Their
discontinuous variants produce piece wise continuous solutions that are
discontinuous at the grid cell boundaries.  Because of the polynomial basis of
the approximate solutions, they contain oscillations near steep flanks,
e.g. shocks, of the exact solution. Two methods are presented to mitigate these
oscillations.  The minmod limiter changes the highest degree polynomial
coefficient to reduce oscillations by comparing for each cell the signs of the
slope to the signs of the approximated curvatures in the vicinity.  The moment
limiter on the other hand remedies some drawbacks of the simple minmod limiter
by enhancing its idea. It iteratively limits the k-th to the first derivative at
most.  A concluding comparison with four sample shapes shows how the moment
limiter of exemplary degree four much better preserves high frequency features
of the solution than the simple minmod limiter.

3.1 Categories

Abstract                                     Points: 4
* I wouldn't reference any literature in the abstract.
* Also mention that you compare how they perform.
* Otherwise: Gives me a good impression of what to expect and if I want to read
  it.

Formal Aspects                               Points: 4
* Instead of R_{>=0} I suggest R_0^+ throughout the text, e.g. in the text below
  equation (1)
* The equations on page 4 that are missing a left hand expression look odd. If
  your equations are too long to fit into a single line, then you can use the
  "multline", "eqnarray" or "align" LaTeX environments.

Structure                                    Points: 5
* Clear structuring. A guiding thread is absolutely present.
* If I had to criticize something: The introduction can only be understood after
  having read section II.

Content, Level of Detail, and Completeness   Points: 4
* "How the solution U is finally used to estimate the derivatives and advance
  the solution to the next time step...": I thought U was an approximation of
  the solution u at time t itself?
* "A limiter in general restricts the steepness of the gradient of U to sensible
  values where the bounds may be computed based on the current state or even set
  based on domain knowledge": Is it really the steepness that is restricted? I
  thought it was the overshoots/extremes/oscillations.
* "In the former the total variation is minimized by the 0-slope because the
  increase in variation at the left boundary is counteracted by the decrease on
  the right side and ...": According to the definition of the total variation
  that you have given, we are minimizing a sum of _absolute_ values, thus there
  is no cancellation (or counteracting as you write). Nevertheless, yes there is
  a minimization; it is obvious that the TV after limiting is smaller than
  before.

Written Style and Readability                Points: 2
* Not sure about this: If the author is only a single person, I would prefer to
  write in the third person form instead of using "we", e.g. "As a consequence
  the limiters we present are only applicable to modal DG." would become "As a
  consequence the limiters presented [here] are only applicable to modal DG."
* I would prefer the term "slope" instead of "gradient" in the context of your
  paper. Maybe even "flank" or "edge" would fit better sometimes. In my
  understanding a gradient is a vector (in the direction of steepest
  ascend). But I may be wrong...
* "A concept at the core" -> "A core concept"
* "... and that the total variation grows as f becomes more wiggly." -> "... and
  that the total variation increases when f contains stronger diverging
  oscillations."?
* "From this follows that solutions..." -> "From this it follows that the
  solutions..."
* "There is actually a class of numerical schemes that will provably never
  produce unphysical extrema..." -> "There is actually a class of numerical
  schemes that is proven to never produce nonphysical extremes"
* "Krivodonova experimented with different variations but none of them worked as
  well as this top-down order." -> "... as good as ..."
* Sometimes a little clumsy, misleading English.

References                                   Points: 4
* I am not sure about this, but in my personal opinion I would not give
  reference in such a detailed way as for example "[6, Sec. 6.7]". And if so,
  then I would write it like "[6] Section 6.7" or "Section 6.7 of [6]".

Conclusion                                   Points: 3
* Very brief. Are there alternatives?

Overall Evaluation                           Points: 4
* Good work. Topic was worked out detailed enough.

3.2 Best and Worst Aspect of the Paper
What is best in the paper?
Very clear structure.

What is worst in the paper?
Worst in the paper is the readability. There are some unclear, mistakable formulations.

3.3 Miscellaneous Comments
* I had the impression that your greatest challenge was expressing yourself in English.
