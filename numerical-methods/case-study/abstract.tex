\begin{abstract}
  We give an overview of a limiter for a discontinuous Galerkin method that retains as high of an order as possible.
  To this end we argue why Godunov's theorem necessitates limiting in high-resolution schemes and why such schemes should strive to be total variation diminishing.
  Then we introduce the minmod-limiter\cite{VanLeer1979} as it was conceived by van Leer.
  Finally we present the moment-limiter\cite{Biswas1994} by Biswas et al., an extension of the minmod limiter, in its generalized form\cite{Krivodonova} by Krivodonova and compare the two of them.
