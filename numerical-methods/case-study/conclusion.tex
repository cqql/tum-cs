\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented the generalized moment limiter for discontinuous Galerkin methods together with its foundation, the minmod limiter, and looked into numerical results, that showcase the limiters utility and effectiveness.

The limiter has further potential for theoretical analysis as well as transfer to related methods.
One should work out the details of the connection between the coefficients and the derivatives of the Legendre polynomials, since such an analysis could yield more insight into the choice of limiter parameters.
Additionally one could research if and how the idea of successive limiting can be transferred to other basis functions.
