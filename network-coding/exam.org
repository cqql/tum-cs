** Maximum Achievable Data Rate

Shannon-Hartley theorem

r_max = B * log_2(1 + 10^(SNR_dB / 10))
      = B * log_2(1 + 10^((antenna signal - antenna noise) / 10))

** Estimated Optimal Transmission Count

d_ij = 1 / (1 - prod_{k < i} epsilon_ik) * (1 + sum_{k < i} (d_kj (1 - epsilon_ik) prod_{l < k} epsilon_il))

** Finite Field (Galois Field)

p prime, n in N. F_q set with |F_q| = p^n. <F, +, *> is a finite field if
- <F, +> is a commutative group
- <F \ {0}, *> is a commutative group
- * is distributive over +

Z_q is only a finite field (with modulo) if n = 1, i.e. q = p

** Binary Extension Fields

F_q[x] = { sum_{i = 0 to n - 1} a_i x^i | a_i in F_2 }
where q = 2^n

** Geometric Series

sum_{k = 0 to n - 1} r^k = (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

** Lossy non-hypergraph model

Lossy wired networks, no broadcast model
Resource share per arc

*** Arc capacities

z_k = tau_k * (1 - epsilon_k)

*** Flow boundo

x <= z

*** Maximum s-t flow

max r s.t. Mx = rd_st
x >= 0
x <= z
z in Z = arc capacity region

** Lossless hypergraph model

Models broadcasts as hyperarcs
Resource share per node

*** Hyperarc capacity

z_j = tau_tail(j)

*** Flow bound

Nx <= z

*** Cut values

v(S) = sum_{hyperarc j crossing cut S} z_j

** Lossy hypergraph model

Models broadcasts as hyperarcs and allows for losses

*** Hyperarc-arc incidence matrix

N = (N_jk) = 1 if k in A_j

*** Hyperarc-hyperarc incidence matrix

Q = (Q_ij) = 1 if A_i cap A_j not empty

*** Hyperarc capacity

z_j = tau_tail(j) * (prod_{k in A_j} (1 - epsilon_k)) * (prod_{k in N_tail(j) setminus A_j} epsilon_k)

*** Broadcast capacity

y_j = tau_tail(j) (1 - prod_{k in A_j} epsilon_k)

*** Flow bound with hyperarc and broadcast capacity region

Nx <= Qz = y

*** Cut values

N = set of nodes
v(S) = sum_{hyperarc j from S _only_ into N setminus S} y_j

*** maximum s-t flow

max r s.t. Mx = rd_st
x >= 0
Nx <= y
y in Y = Broadcast capacity region
